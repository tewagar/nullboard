There are a few things that i consider of prioritary importance, be them or not on line with the personal needs or inmediate interest or our 'benevolent dictator' (with all the due respect)

      As i am strongly biased against many modern trends regarding design and UIX, this i a 'declaration of principles' to set my goals straigh (and spare some critic and mean comments):
      I WILL PRIORITIZE TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITY. Period. 
      
      Later, IF TIME AND WILL AND SKILLS AND MOOD allow, may bee i will rework it to adapt to 'Best Practices'
